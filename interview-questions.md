# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions:
A higher-order function is a built in method in JavaScript that takes in a function as an argument. Often higher-order functions are designed to operate on arrays. The function passed as an argument will execute once for every item in the array. This makes higher-order functions incredible useful for iteration.

2. Jest:
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework.
3. Objects:
An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).
